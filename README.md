# [jyBaseball](https://vaclisinc.github.io/jyBaseball/) - Baseball Data Digitization and Analysis Platform

[jyBaseball(棒球紀錄趣)](https://vaclisinc.github.io/jyBaseball/) is a platform designed to digitize traditional paper-based baseball records and provide advanced data analysis tools. Our goal is to support both professional and amateur baseball teams by offering intuitive tools for recording, storing, and analyzing game data. One of our key features is K-Zone batting average analysis, but we place equal emphasis on making baseball data more accessible and actionable by moving away from paper-based systems.

## Current Status and Limitations

**Important Note:** jyBaseball is currently in a prototype stage. The full functionality, including the generation of hitting zone charts, is only available when the backend is running on the developer's local machine. We are actively working on deploying a stable backend solution to make all features accessible online.

## Key Features

1. **Paper-based Data Digitization**
   - Convert traditional paper-based baseball records into digital form
   - Secure and centralized data storage using Google Sheets for easy access and management

2. **Data Input and Storage**
   - User-friendly interface for inputting detailed game statistics
   - Centralized storage of game data to support long-term tracking and analysis

3. **Advanced Statistical Analysis**
   - Comprehensive calculations based on input data
   - Generation of various statistical insights, including K-Zone batting average analysis

4. **Visual Representation of Data**
   - Visual representation of hitting patterns and weaknesses
   - Generation of hitting zone charts and other statistical graphs
   - Note: Full visualization features are currently available only when the backend is running locally, but history records can still be viewed

5. **Cross-platform Compatibility**
   - Web-based design accessible from any device
   - Responsive interface for desktop and mobile use

6. **Real-time Data Processing** (When backend is active)
   - Instant data analysis and visualization
   - Quick insights for coaches and analysts

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (HTML5 UP template)
- Backend: Python for data processing and visualization
- Database: Google Sheets for data storage
- APIs: Google API for data interaction

## Getting Started

To use the current version:

1. Visit [jyBaseball](https://vaclisinc.github.io/jyBaseball/)
2. Input detailed game data
3. View stored data on the website

Please note that while data input and storage are always available, the generation of visual representations (like hitting zone charts) is only accessible when the backend is actively running on the developer's local machine.

## Future Development Plans

1. **Backend Deployment**: Our top priority is to deploy a stable, always-on backend service to enable full functionality for all users at any time.

2. **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Expand our range of visual representations and statistical analyses.

3. **Real-time Integration**: Develop capabilities for instant data analysis and visualization during live games.

4. **CPBL Integration**: Explore possibilities of integrating with CPBL's official statistical systems.

5. **Mobile App Development**: Create a dedicated mobile app for on-the-go analysis.
